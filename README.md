Twin Peaks Website

Install Python (latest version) and Flask (pip) to run it
To install Python, head to https://www.python.org/downloads/
To install Flask, install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), then in command prompt / terminal, type: pip install flask

After installing both of them, you can download the code for the website by clicking the green "code" button, which should pop up a clone dropdown menu.
Click "Download ZIP", then extract it on your computer

Afterwards, run the site.py file using Python.
It should say "Serving Flask app... Running on http://..."
After the "running on" part, copy the http link (should just be http:// then a string of numbers and symbols), and put that in browser, and there's your website.
